Small simple project to experiment with C++, OpenGl, SDL2
Started out as a expiriment into C++ expression templates.
Implemented:
1) OBJ and MTL file import
2) 3D rendering of models and voxels
3) shader support
4) World generation using noise
5) Map load and unload when moving around
6) Removed voxel faces that cant be seen to improve FPS
7) Usage of 3D textures for voxel texturing

Future:
1) Further optimization to improve FPS
2) Research into meshing algorithms to reduce data sent to GPU
